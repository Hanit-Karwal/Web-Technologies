            <h3> HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT & PHP</h3>
    
        <p class="p1">HTML :</p><br>
        <div class="div1">
             stands for Hyper Text Markup Language,
             which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages. 
             HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard 
             HTML specification which was published in 1995. 
             HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. 
             Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version 
             which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.
        </div>
        <p class="p2">CSS :</p><br>
        <div class="div2">
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the 
            presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. 
            CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, 
            colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more 
            flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable 
            multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file 
            which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling 
            the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the 
            file and its formatting.
        </div>

        <p class="p3">JAVASCRIPT :</p><br>
        <div class="div3">
            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming 
            language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language 
            for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB 
            and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic 
            language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming)
            styles. 
        </div>

        <p class="p4">PHP :</p><br>
        <div class="div4">
            PHP is a general-purpose scripting language especially suited to web development. 
            It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. 
            The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. 
            PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[6] but it now stands for the recursive 
            initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a 
            PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) 
            executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may 
            be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or 
            part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and 
            web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that 
            response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web 
            context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. 
            PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.
