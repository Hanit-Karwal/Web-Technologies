<h1>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h1>
<p>In this article, we will have an in-depth analysis of B.E./B.Tech.
 Information Technology course. IT (Information Technology) is a relatively new Engineering branch.
 Despite its late entry, it quickly became popular among students and used to create numerous job opportunities with decent pay packages!

 But with recession, the reputation of this Engineering Branch took a dent. Still, if pursued from a reputed Institute, IT Engineering is a valuable course.
 In this article, I will provide information about B.E./B.Tech. 
Information Technology program such as- basic course details, course duration, eligibility criteria, important subjects present, scope and job opportunities.</p>

<pre> Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data[1] or information. 
IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies
.[2] IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology (ICT).
 An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking,
 a computer system – including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of IT users.
Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC.
[3] However, the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J.
 Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT)."
 Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, 
and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.
